# SeedGn

> [!TIP] 
> ### Mnemonic seed phrase generator. Generation seed phrase and checking balance (Btc, Eth, Sol, Ton). Automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for many networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named result.txt.
